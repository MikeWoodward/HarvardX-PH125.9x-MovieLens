# HarvardX-PH125.9x-MovieLens
Repository for the course capstone project. This is for the MovieLens project.

The key files here are:

* MovieLens.R - the r file for this project. It can be run interactivey or as a script. Running the file will produce a data folder and it will write the intermediate and final calculations to .rda files in the data folder. To duplicate the project results, you'll need to run this file first.

* MovieLens.Rmd - an r markdown file that generates the report. It needs the data folder and the .rda files generated by the MovieLens.R file. However, I have also uploaded the .rda files to Github so you could download them as an alternative to running the MovieLens.R file.

* MovieLens.pdf - the final project report.

* MovieLens.Rproj - the r studio file.

* data - the data folder containing the .rda data files.
